# Project1
### App Name	
Excites and Bites

### Description	
Our team created an app that finds events given an event category, location, and date.  It allows a user to find out details of up to eight events that fit the aforementioned criteria, including the event date, address, venue, description, location (displayed on a map), and six categories of nearby eating establishments.

### Motivation (what problems it solves)	
How many times have you gone to an event in a location you are not familiar with and after the event you are hungry and have no idea where any good nearby restaurants are located. Our team wanted to create this app to help people find exciting events anywhere in the world, and also to find bites to eat within the geographical vicinity of those events.  This app solves the problem of users needing to visit multiple different websites (eg. eventful.com and google.com/maps) to find both an event and event location since our app provides both on a single website.  The app also excites and informs users about local eating establishments for either planned or spontaneous outings.

### Result		
Our team used Eventful API and Google Maps API to retrieve events based on users’ specifications, and geographic locations and nearby eating establishments of those events, respectively.  We also used Firebase to store e-mail addresses of users who wish to be added to the APP’s mailing list.
